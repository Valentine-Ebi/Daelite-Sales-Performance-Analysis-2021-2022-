## Insights/Findings
### Performance by Year and Month
•	**Yearly Performance**: There was a significant increase in profit from **₦7,908,640** in 2021 to **₦8,985,100** in 2022, indicating strong year-over-year growth.

•	**Monthly Performance**: The profit trend by month shows seasonality in sales, with notable peaks and troughs throughout the year. This suggests that marketing and sales efforts could be timed to coincide with these peak periods.

### Product Performance
•	**Top Selling Products**: The "Paseo" product is the clear leader in sales, generating **₦33,011,130**. This is followed by **"VTT"** and **"Velo"** with sales of **₦20,511,890** and **₦18,250,080**, respectively.

•	**Units Sold by Product**: The "Paseo" product also accounts for the largest share of units sold at **30.04%**. The other products have a relatively even distribution of units sold, ranging from **13.04% to 14.45%**.

### Segment Performance
•	**Top Segments by Sales**: The "Small Business" segment is the most significant contributor to sales, with a total of **₦42,427,960**. The "Enterprise" and "Government" segments also represent substantial portions of the sales.

•	**Profitability by Segment**: The "Government" segment is the most profitable, contributing **18.10%** of the total profit with the "Paseo" product. However, the "Enterprise" segment shows a net loss across all products, indicating potential issues with pricing, costs, or discounts in this segment.

### Geographic Performance
•	**Top Countries by Sales**: The analysis of the top 5 countries by sales reveals that Japan is the leading market with **₦18,449,950** in sales. France and England are also key markets, with sales of **₦17,723,150** and **₦16,979,980**, respectively.

## Recommendations
Based on the insights gathered from the sales data, the following recommendations are proposed for the management to implement:
1.	**Focus on High-Performing Products**: Double down on the marketing and sales efforts for the "Paseo" product, given its dominant position in both sales and units sold.

2.	**Optimize Segment Strategy**:

    •	**Small Business**: Continue to nurture and grow the "**Small Business**" segment as it is the largest source of revenue.

    •	**Government**: Leverage the high profitability of the "**Government**" segment by exploring opportunities for upselling and cross-selling.

    •	**Enterprise**: Conduct a thorough review of the "**Enterprise**" segment to identify the root causes of the net loss. This may involve reassessing pricing strategies, discount             structures, or the cost of goods sold for this segment.

3.	**Geographic Expansion**: Capitalize on the strong performance in **Japan**, **France**, and **England**. Consider targeted marketing campaigns to further penetrate these markets.

4.	**Seasonal Marketing Campaigns**: Align marketing campaigns with the observed monthly sales trends to maximize impact during peak seasons and to stimulate demand during slower months.

## Conclusion
The sales analysis for 2021 and 2022 indicates a healthy and growing business with a significant increase in profitability. The "Paseo" product and the "Small Business" segment are the primary drivers of this success. However, the lack of profitability in the "Enterprise" segment requires immediate attention. By focusing on the identified strengths and addressing the weaknesses, there is a substantial opportunity to further enhance sales performance and overall profitability. The recommendations provided in this report offer a clear path toward achieving these goals.
